# README.md: ZKPServicesCore

## Overview
ZKPServicesCore is a robust smart contract built on the Ethereum platform, written in Solidity ^0.8.7. The contract serves as an advanced data management system leveraging cryptographic proofs and two-factor authentication mechanisms. It blends the power of decentralized platforms with RSA and AES encryption techniques, providing a secure medium to request, update, and validate obfuscated data.

## Features
### 1. Token System (the tokenomics aspect is just implemented for testing to demonstrate token utility):
- **ERC20Burnable Token:** Built on the ERC20 standard with burn capabilities.
- **Token Distribution:** Upon deployment, half of the ZKP tokens are allocated to the contract deployer and the other half to the contract itself.
- **Vault System:** Allows users to request a limited amount of tokens from the contract's vault.

### 2. Data Management:
- **RSA Key Registration:** Users can register their RSA public keys, enabling data encryption and decryption.
- **Data Storage:** Store obfuscated (hashed) data linked to a unique identifier.
- **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):** Enhanced security by integrating with different 2FA providers.
- **Data Requests:** Encrypted data requests that are accessible only by designated recipients.
- **Data Updates:** Encrypted requests for data modifications.

### 3. Zero-Knowledge Proofs:
- Uses the Groth16 verification system to ensure data authenticity without revealing the actual data.

## Functions Breakdown

### Constructor
Initializes the contract, sets the Groth16 verifier, mints the total ZKP tokens supply, and defines the request and response fees.

### Public Functions
- **`requestVaultTokens`**: Allows users to retrieve a limited number of tokens from the contract's vault.
- **`setRSAKey`**: Enables users to register their RSA public key.
- **`setObfuscatedData`**: Store obfuscated data and its associated signature.
- **`addTwoFAProvider` & `removeTwoFAProvider`**: Functions for the owner to manage approved 2FA providers.
- **`requestData` & `requestUpdate`**: Functions for users to initiate encrypted data requests or updates.
- **`respond`**: Used by users to answer to requests or updates using zero-knowledge proofs for data verification.

## Security & Authentication
- **RSA & AES Encryption:** Ensures encrypted data transfer, only accessible by designated recipients.
- **2FA:** An additional layer of security to validate data requests and updates.
- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKP):** Provides a way to verify the authenticity of obfuscated data without revealing the actual data.

## Advantages
- **Data Privacy:** Only hashed data is stored, preserving data confidentiality.
- **Enhanced Security:** Incorporates RSA, AES encryption, and two-factor authentication.
- **Decentralized System:** Utilizes the strengths of decentralized platforms to ensure data transparency and integrity.
- **Economic Incentives:** Uses the ZKP token system to ensure participants are compensated or penalized for their actions within the ecosystem.

## In Summary
ZKPServicesCore offers a new paradigm in secure data management on the Ethereum blockchain. By seamlessly integrating tokenomics, encryption, and verification systems, the contract provides a sophisticated tool for Web3 developers seeking a reliable and secure data management solution.
