# Make a Data Request

## 1 - Prepare your Data

Before you start, here's an overview of what you'll need to make a data request:

**a. Encrypted Request:** This is the data you want to request.
**b. Encrypted Key:** A secure key to help decrypt the data once you receive it.
**c. Time Limit:** How long before the recipient must respond to your data request.
**d. 2FA Information (*optional*):** If you want added security, you can make it so that the responder has to undergo a 2FA requirement before responding.
**e. Response fee:** A data request will cost 10 ZKP tokens by default. If you require more ZKP tokens from whom you are requesting data, increase the number.

## 2 - Check your balance

Make sure you have some ZKP tokens in your wallet.

If the recipient approves your data request, you may now retrieve the data.

Approved data requests will be encrypted, so to access this data, you must use the encrypted key that you prepared in step \[1] to reveal the requested data.
