**What is zkp.services?**

**Introduction**

Standing at the intersection of data privacy and security, zkp.services
aims to redefine data management standards worldwide. With the Ethereum
blockchain as our foundation, we offer a seamless fusion of cryptography
and advanced encryption.

Our vision transcends traditional boundaries; our team aims to reshape
the landscape of secure data exchange and storage. With zkp.services,
we\'re not just building a product but pioneering a movement towards a
safer, more transparent, decentralized digital future.

**What are zero-knowledge proofs?**

To understand what we do here, you need to start with understanding
zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs).

***Definition***

At its core, a ZKP is a cryptographic method that allows one party to
prove to another party that a statement is true without revealing any
specific information about the statement itself.

Imagine you have a secret password and want to prove to someone that you
know the password without actually revealing it.

ZKP makes this possible.

ZKP.services combines this cryptographic technique with smart contracts
on the Ethereum blockchain to manage and verify obfuscated (hidden or
scrambled) data.

We use advanced encryption techniques like RSA and AES to ensure data is
securely stored and transferred. We also add layers of security with
features like 2-factor authentication (2FA) and token systems while
still maintaining data privacy.

Our protocol offers a secure platform where data can be stored,
requested, updated, and validated without the entire data set becoming
exposed. Instead, mathematical proofs verify the authenticity and
integrity of the data, ensuring both privacy and trustworthiness.

***Simplified variation***

To help you understand what ZKP is, think of "Where's Waldo?".

In \"Where\'s Waldo?\", you try to find Waldo among a crowd in those
big, busy pictures.

Now, imagine if you had a magical book where, instead of showing the
whole picture to a friend, you could simply prove to them that Waldo is
indeed in the picture without revealing where.

ZKP serves as that magical book.

In the digital world, much information, like Waldo, is hidden in the
crowd.

With ZKP, you can prove specific things about your information (like
where Waldo is in the picture) without showing the entire picture.

So, just as you wouldn't need to point out Waldo's exact location, with
ZKP, you can keep your digital secrets safe and still convince others of
certain truths about them.

**Features**

Data is an all-encompassing industry.

Everything in today\'s world is tied to data in some way, and it can
arguably become the most valuable resource in the world within many
contexts.

With that in mind, there are a plethora of industries in which
zkp.services may fit itself into, so before niching down into particular
sectors, we want to highlight what you\'re able to do with our
foundational features:

-   **Initiate data requests and updates**

> A user can securely ask to view or modify another user\'s stored data
> using ZKP. All the while maintaining complete control over their data,
> deciding when and how it should be accessed or altered.

-   **Reply to Data requests**

> Users can reply to data inquiries, proving specific things about their
> data without exposing unnecessary information.

-   **Manage security providers**

> A user can integrate additional security layers to their data.
> Organizations can ensure that only authenticated users make
> significant changes or requests.

-   **Secure data storage**

> Store confidential data in your system in a hidden format. Only its
> \'proof of existence\' is visible, not the content.

-   **Encryption key registration**

> A user can register a unique encryption key with us. This feature
> ensures that data is locked and can only be unlocked by the user\'s
> unique key, keeping it safe from unauthorized access.

-   **Token Access and Management**

> Users can spend and gain ZKP tokens within our system when they
> request data. Discounted rates with our ZKP tokens provide an
> incentive for various actions.

**Use cases**

Our team wants to build a modular and easy-to-adopt zero-knowledge proof
service.

Why?

Because there are thousands of use cases for data that we can fit into.

We want anyone to be able to leverage the benefits of zero-knowledge
proofs without the technical hassle and know-how.

Here are some critical use cases that we believe will lead to
zero-knowledge proofs having an immense impact on the world:

-   **Identity**

> The primary use case that most relevant ZKP protocols are currently
> pursuing in some way, shape or form.
>
> There are many things about our identity that we are forced to share
> with authorities. In most cases, these are justified requests. But in
> all instances, we reveal more than we have to.
>
> Take, for instance, the following scenarios:

-   *Age Verification*

> Prove you\'re above a certain age (e.g., 18) without revealing your
> exact age or date of birth.

-   *Membership verification*

> Confirm membership in a club or organization without revealing member
> details (such as your address)

-   *Credential verification*

> Prove academic or professional credentials without revealing specifics
> (such as where you attended)

-   **Healthcare**

> Sharing medical data is often necessary, but traditional systems can
> overshare and compromise patient privacy.
>
> In the medical field, unauthorized or accidental access to patient
> data (such as with system oversights of third-party data breaches)
> compromises patient confidentiality and trust. ZKP allows medical
> professionals to verify necessary patient information without exposing
> the entirety of their medical history.
>
> Only relevant data is accessed whilst patient privacy is preserved.
>
> Take, for instance, the following scenarios:

-   *Medical History*

> Patients can prove they have been vaccinated or have no history of a
> particular ailment without revealing their entire medical records.

-   *Insurance claims*

> People can submit claims by proving medical procedures or treatments
> occurred without exposing all medical details.

-   *Prescription verification*

> Patients can prove they have a prescription for certain medications
> without disclosing the medical condition they treat.

-   **Supply chain**

> The supply chain industry has a universal trust issue. Many bad actors
> in this world consistently succeed in taking advantage of consumers.
> In contrast, many great actors want to better the world with ethical
> and sustainable practices.
>
> Both need checks and balances in place to provide complete
> transparency across a product\'s history - ZKP can accomplish just
> that without revealing unnecessary company or manufacturer trade
> secrets.
>
> Take, for instance, the following scenarios:

-   *Materials verification*

> Confirm that a product is made from specified materials (e.g., 100%
> cotton) without revealing supplier information.

-   *Product authenticity*

> Prove the authenticity of a product without revealing trade secrets or
> proprietary methods.

-   *Source verification*

> Verify the origin of a product without revealing the entire supply
> chain.

-   *Financial services*

> It is a pivotal sector for any state where trust, discretion, and
> verification intersect. Traditional financial systems often expose
> more personal data than required, leading to potentially expensive
> vulnerabilities.
>
> Take, for instance, the following scenarios:

-   *Loan eligibility*

> Users can demonstrate they meet loan criteria without revealing
> specifics of their financial commitments.

-   *Credit checks*

> Users can prove they have a good credit score without revealing their
> financial history.

-   *Account balance verification*

> People can prove they have a minimum balance without disclosing the
> exact amount.

-   **Legal & Compliance**

> The legal sector needs to improve its operational inefficiencies and
> dated ways of working.
>
> In many instances, both parties to a case are forced to reveal data
> unnecessarily. Even despite standard Discovery practices providing
> opportunities for the court to step in and redact what providing
> parties request their opposition not to see, others still become able
> to see this data regardless of whether it makes it to the other party
> in a case.
>
> Take, for instance, the following scenarios:

-   *Case histories*

> Lawyers can prove the existence of past verdicts without revealing
> client details or case specifics.

-   *Regulatory compliance*

> Companies can provide compliance with regulations without revealing
> sensitive internal processes.

-   *Reasonable accommodation verification*

> Individuals with disabilities can prove they\'ve requested specific
> accommodations (e.g., wheelchair access) from employers without
> revealing the nature or extent of their disability.

Here is a non-exhaustive list of 590 use cases we\'ve come up with (and
yes, there are more.)
