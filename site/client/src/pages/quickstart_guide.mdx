# Quickstart

This form will allow you to set up the necessary parameters required to use various zkp.services. 
These consist of a DB password, 2FA password, smart contract password, RSA encryption keys, and RSA signing keys. 
The role of each is subsequently explained.

<Note>
  Please make sure you have a positive balance of the native currency of the EVM-compatible chain you are trying to onboard to.

### Database Password

The database password will allow you to securely authenticate access to data stored with your chosen data provider, which will house
your data stored at rest.

### 2FA Password

The 2FA password is used to validate that you are you through knowledge of an additional secret password with our trustless, decentralized 2FA provider.

### Smart Contract Password

This is a password string that is used to obfuscate at which fields in the smart contract mappings proofs of plaintext data are stored.
For example, `"Pharmacy Records for Good Pharmacy Co." => { obfuscated proof of data }` becomes 
`"fdq928888f0q9u3333fuh0q98324fh9qqqqqqqq" => { obfuscated proof of data }`

### RSA Encryption Keys

Used to encrypt communications between two entities - that is, used to encrypt requests and responses for information.

### RSA Signing Keys

Used to sign and validate stored data.
