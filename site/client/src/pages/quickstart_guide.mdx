your database password, zkp.services 2FA provider password, smart contract password for obfuscation, 
RSA encryption keys and RSA signing keys. All parameters are further elaborated upon in each of their 
respective sections, however, if you have any further issues or questions, please feel free to reach us at

# Description of Parameters

<div className="mt-6">
### Database Password

The database password will allow you to securely authenticate access to data stored with your chosen data provider, which will house
your data stored at rest.

### 2FA Password

The 2FA password is used to validate that you are you through knowledge of an additional secret password with our trustless, decentralized 2FA provider.

### Smart Contract Password

This is a password string that is used to obfuscate at which fields in the smart contract mappings/dictionaries proofs of plaintext data are stored.
For example, `"Pharmacy Records for Good Pharmacy Co."` becomes `"fdq928888f0q9u3333fuh0q98324fh9qqqqqqqq"` in the smart contract as the location
of the proof for this pharmacy records field. The proof of the plaintext data is also obfuscated so it cannot be easily read, as is the case with the
field/location.

### RSA Encryption Keys

Used to encrypt communications between two entities - that is, used to encrypt requests and responses for information.

### RSA Signing Keys

Used to sign and validate stored data.
