# **What is zkp.services?**

## **Introduction**

In a data-driven world, zkp.services is providing a straightforward solution to manage information with precision and trust. Powered by the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and fine-tuned for all Solidity-compatible chains, we’re changing the playbook on data management.

We believe in clarity, not complexity.

Safeguarding data, not just storing it.

Our vision transcends traditional boundaries; our team aims to reshape the landscape of secure data exchange and storage. With zkp.services, we're not just building a product but pioneering a movement towards a safer, more transparent, decentralized digital future.



## **What are zero-knowledge proofs?**

To understand what we do here, you need to start with understanding zero-knowledge proofs ("ZKPs").

#### **Definition**

At its core, a ZKP is a cryptographic method that allows one party to prove to another party that a statement is true without revealing any specific information about the statement itself.

Imagine you have a secret password and want to prove to someone that you know it without revealing it.

ZKP makes this possible.

Combining this cryptographic technique with smart contracts, zkp.services manages and verifies obfuscated (hidden or scrambled) data.

We use advanced encryption techniques like RSA and AES to ensure data is securely stored and transferred. We also add layers of security with features like 2-factor authentication ("2FA") and token systems while still maintaining data privacy.

Our protocol offers a secure solution where data can be stored, requested, updated, and validated without sensitive data becoming exposed. Instead, mathematical proofs verify the authenticity and integrity of the data, ensuring both privacy and trustworthiness.


#### **Simplifying ZKP**

To help you understand what ZKP is, think of “Where’s Waldo?”.

In "Where's Waldo?", you try to find Waldo among a crowd in those big, busy pictures.

Now, imagine if you had a magical book where, instead of showing the whole picture to a friend, you could simply prove to them that Waldo is indeed in the picture without revealing where.

ZKP serves as that magical book.

In the digital world, much information, like Waldo, is hidden in the crowd.

With ZKP, you can prove specific things about your information, like where Waldo is in the picture, without showing the entire picture.

So, just as you wouldn’t need to point out Waldo’s exact location, with ZKP, you can keep your digital secrets safe and still convince others of certain truths about them.



## **Features**

Data plays a pivotal role across all industries, shaping decisions, strategies, and innovations.

Everything in today's world is tied to data in some way, and it can arguably become the most valuable resource in the world within many contexts.

With that, there are a plethora of industries in which zkp.services may become suitable, so before niching down into particular sectors, we want to highlight what you're able to do with our foundational features:

1. **Initiate data requests and updates**
   A user can securely ask to view or modify another user's stored data using ZKP. All the while maintaining complete control over their data, deciding when and how it should be accessed or altered.

2. **Reply to Data requests**
   Users can reply to data inquiries, proving specific things about their data without exposing unnecessary information.

3. **Manage security providers (2FA / MFA)**
   A user can integrate additional security layers to their data. Organizations can ensure that only authenticated users make significant changes or requests.

4. **Secure data storage**
   Store confidential data in your system in a hidden format. Only its 'proof of existence' is visible, not the content.

5. **Token Access and Management**
   Users can spend ZKP tokens within our system when they request data. Discounted rates will apply with our ZKP tokens, incentivising various actions.



# **Use cases**

Our team has built a modular and easy-to-adopt service that leverages zero-knowledge proofs.

We want anyone to be able to leverage the benefits of zero-knowledge proofs without the technical hassle and know-how.

There is no shortage of use cases that zkp.services can fit into. Here are some critical use cases that we believe will lead to zero-knowledge proofs having an immense impact on the world:

1. **Identity**

Identity is the primary use case that most relevant ZKP protocols are currently pursuing in some way, shape, or form.

There are many things about our identity that we are forced to share with authorities. In most cases, these are justified requests. But in all instances, we reveal more than we have to.

Take, for instance, the following scenarios:&#x20;

* **Age Verification**
  Prove you're above a certain age (e.g., 18) without revealing your exact age or date of birth.
* **Membership verification**
  Confirm membership in a club or organization without revealing member details (such as your address).
* **Credential verification**
  Prove academic or professional credentials without revealing specifics (such as where you attended).
* **KYC verification**
  Prove to an organisation or company that you are who you say you are without revealing your passport, license, or other documents.


2. **Healthcare**

Sharing medical data is often necessary, but traditional systems can overshare and compromise patient privacy.

In the medical field, unauthorized or accidental access to patient data, such as with system oversights of third-party data breaches, compromises patient confidentiality and trust. ZKP allows medical professionals to verify necessary patient information without exposing the entirety of their medical history.

Only relevant data is accessed whilst patient privacy is preserved.

Take, for instance, the following scenarios:

* **Medical History**
  Patients can prove they have been vaccinated or have no history of a particular ailment without revealing their entire medical records.
* **Insurance claims**
  People can submit claims by proving medical procedures or treatments occurred without exposing all medical details.
* **Prescription verification**
  Patients can prove they have a prescription for certain medications without disclosing the medical condition they treat.



3. **Supply chain**

The supply chain industry has a universal trust issue. Many bad actors in this world consistently succeed in taking advantage of consumers. In contrast, many good actors want to better the world with ethical and sustainable practices.

Both need checks and balances in place to provide complete transparency across a product's history. ZKP can accomplish just that without revealing unnecessary company or manufacturer trade secrets.

Take, for instance, the following scenarios:

* **Materials verification**
  Confirm that a product is made from specified materials (e.g., 100% cotton) without revealing supplier information.
* **Product authenticity**
  Prove the authenticity of a product without revealing trade secrets or proprietary methods.
* **Source verification**
  Verify the origin of a product without revealing particulars about the entire supply chain.



4. **Financial services**

This is a pivotal sector for any state where trust, discretion, and verification intersect. Traditional financial systems often expose more personal data than required, leading to potentially expensive vulnerabilities.

Take, for instance, the following scenarios:

* **Loan eligibility**
  Users can demonstrate they meet loan criteria without revealing specifics of their financial commitments.
* **Credit checks**
  Users can prove they have a good credit score without revealing their financial history.
* **Account balance verification**
  People can prove they have a minimum balance without disclosing the exact amount.



5. **Legal & Compliance**

The legal sector needs to improve its operational inefficiencies and dated working methods.

It is not uncommon for both parties in a legal dispute to be compelled to reveal irrelevant data. Although the standard discovery process allows for confidential information to be redacted, other parties such as the judge may still have access to it, regardless of whether it is shared with the opposing party.h the opposing party or not.

Take, for instance, the following scenarios:

* **Case histories**
  Lawyers can prove the existence of past verdicts without revealing client details or case specifics.
* **Regulatory compliance**
  Companies can provide compliance with regulations without revealing sensitive internal processes.
* **Reasonable accommodation verification**
  Individuals with disabilities can prove they've requested specific accommodations (e.g., wheelchair access) from employers without revealing the nature or extent of their disability.
