# Your Data and How We Handle It
## Data Handling
zkp.services makes the security and trustworthiness of your data are our top priorities. We've carefully crafted our data management system to ensure your information is protected at all times, whether it's resting in our secure storage or on the move.

**Data at Rest:** When your data is stored in our default database, it's shielded with 256-bit AES-GCM encryption. We go a step further by storing it across multiple availability zones, adding redundancy to safeguard your data's integrity.

**Data in Transit:** As your data travels through our system, it's encased in layers of encryption. All communications with our main API and database start with 256-bit AES encryption and are then wrapped tightly through TLS. This virtually eliminates the risk of man-in-the-middle attacks. Even our communications with our smart contract are fortified using a blend of hashing and one-time keys, ensuring your data remains locked away from prying eyes.

## Data Providers
We understand that not all data sources are the same. That's why we give you the flexibility to bring your own databases into our system. This way, you can take advantage of our powerful AWS API endpoints while maintaining the unique qualities of your data.

## Our Data & API Reference
Our aim is to make the integration of our data and API endpoints as smooth as possible. To achieve this, we offer comprehensive documentation and support on our website. Our user-friendly interface allows you to cherry-pick the services you want to connect to your dashboard, giving you full control over your data-sharing preferences. And if you ever decide to remove a service, rest assured that your data and all related information are promptly and completely removed from our system.

## Integrating a Custom Data Provider
We believe in putting you in charge of your data sources. That's why we offer the option to integrate your own data providers into our ecosystem. If you have your own databases hosted on the Interplanetary File System (IPFS) or other platforms, we provide the tools and documentation you need to make it happen. This empowers you to tailor your data sources to your unique needs while benefiting from the security and reliability of our infrastructure.

zkp.services is dedicated to secure, trustless, and decentralized data management. Our meticulous approach to data protection, collaboration with diverse data providers, and commitment to empowering you through custom data integration make us a leader in the field. As the digital landscape evolves, you can count on us to safeguard your data and your autonomy. Your data is more than just information; it's your digital identity, and we're here to ensure it stays in your control, securely and trustlessly.
