| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Request                    | This is the data you want to request.                                                                                              |
| Key                        | A secure key to help decrypt data once you receive it.                                                                             |

| Set Response Fee      | The response fee will be the number of ZKP tokens the requestee requires to answer your request.                                                                                            |
