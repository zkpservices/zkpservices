## <h1>How Does It Work in a Nutshell?</h1>

The zkp.services protocol utilizes zero-knowledge proofs to enhance user control over data while ensuring compliance 
and auditing standards are met. In essence, it allows users to upload their encrypted data to a Web2/Web3 data provider 
of their choice, such as IPFS or AWS. This data can then be used according to their needs, whether it's sharing with 
authorized parties at specific times or updating the stored data as required.

A significant aspect of this protocol is its ability to allow data recipients to verify the authenticity of received 
data or confirm the execution of requested updates (like reducing a balance for metro access) without compromising 
the user's privacy. This approach effectively balances compliance needs with privacy preservation.

The protocol functions by storing data either on-chain or off-chain, but revealing it only through selective snapshots. 
To validate the legitimacy of such data or updates, cryptographic techniques like hash functions and zero-knowledge 
proofs are employed. Users upload 'proofs' or 'signatures' related to specific data fields or updates to a smart 
contract. This enables them to provide evidence of lawful actions by referencing these proofs in the smart contract 
when sharing data or claiming updates. It is crucial to note that the cryptographic techniques employed also allow
users to maintain their privacy, such that what they are doing remains secret albeit verified and/or selectively
revealed to parties of their choosing.

The use of ZKPs and hashing algorithms in zkp.services provides a cryptographic guarantee of the legality and validity 
of the data or updates, verified through a simple check by the recipient. Additionally, users can digitally sign their 
uploaded data with RSA keys associated with zkp.services or their own private keys.

The scalability of this protocol is attributed to the scalability properties of hash functions, which can efficiently 
process data of any size. ZKPs and hash functions together facilitate the efficient and selective revelation of subsets 
of a larger data set. The current implementation uses a Merkle Tree-like structure for this purpose, but the protocol is 
exploring other methods, such as Cryptographic Accumulators, for future enhancements.

To ensure adaptability with technological advances, plans are in place to allow users to select their preferred ZKP 
algorithms, moving away from the default Poseidon hash function and Groth16 verifier. Furthermore, the integration of Chainlink 
CCIP and a customizable MFA system, which attaches MFA requirements to data requests, adds another layer of robustness 
to the protocol. 

zkp.services' design also allows for straightforward integration into other applications, facilitated by the API 
guide and smart contracts provided by zkp.services. This makes it a versatile and adaptable solution for developers 
looking to incorporate secure data management into their applications.

## <h1>Leveraging Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs)</h1>

Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) stand as a cornerstone technology in the zkp.services protocol, offering a powerful
means to ensure data privacy and authenticity. A ZKP is a cryptographic method where one party (the prover) can prove
to another (the verifier) the truth of a statement, without revealing any information apart from the fact that the statement
is indeed true. This technology is integral to our protocol for its ability to facilitate secure and private verification 
processes.

The integration of Zero-Knowledge Proofs in zkp.services enables secure and private verification of data possession and updates.
It ensures that while data authenticity and compliance are maintained, the privacy of the underlying information remains intact.
This blend of security and privacy is what sets our protocol apart in the realm of data management and exchange.

- **Proving Possession of Data**: At the heart of our ZKP implementation is the capability for users to assert ownership or 
possession of data without exposing the data itself. This aspect is vital in scenarios where verification is necessary but 
privacy is paramount. For instance, a user can demonstrate that they meet the legal age requirement for alcohol consumption 
without disclosing their exact age or identity details. Our protocol leverages ZKPs to validate data ownership while keeping 
specific data attributes concealed, relying solely on mathematical and programming principles.

- **Verifiably Legal Updates to Data**: Our protocol also empowers users to perform legally compliant and verifiable updates to 
their data. This functionality is key to maintaining the integrity and trustworthiness of the system. Consider a scenario where 
a pharmacist requests a patient to update their prescription information. Using ZKPs, the pharmacist can verify that the update 
has been made without accessing the sensitive details of the patient's medical records or prescription. This ensures a secure 
and private exchange of information, adhering to legal and ethical standards.

## <h1>Custom MFA and Sybil Attack Resistance</h1>

The zkp.services protocol acknowledges the diverse additional security needs of different data applications. The security
demands for verifying identity documents at a border control are vastly different from those for checking the balance on a
transportation card, for example. This diversity, coupled with the inevitable occurrence of false positives and negatives
in identity verification mechanisms, necessitates a flexible and robust multi-factor authentication (MFA) framework.

### Trustless, On-Chain MFA Provider

Our protocol features a unique, trustless MFA provider that operates entirely on-chain. This system is crafted using a
combination of Chainlink Verifiable Random Functions (VRFs), Chainlink Automation, and Zero Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs).
This innovative blend ensures:

- **Trustless Verification:** Users can prove knowledge of a secret or a set of secrets without actual disclosure.
- **Timeliness Proof via Chainlink VRFs:** The VRFs act as a one-time token, indicating the timeliness of a request.
  This ensures the authentication is relevant and current.
- **Scalability Through Chainlink Automation:** The MFA service is economically scalable, with a single VRF capable of
  covering all MFA requests within a specified time frame (e.g., five minutes). This approach efficiently handles
  thousands of requests per minute.

### Customizable MFA for Smart Services

Beyond our in-house MFA solution, the protocol offers an interface for MFA verification tailored to the specific needs
of different services. This feature allows:

- **Integration of External MFA Logic:** Services can associate the address of a smart contract containing their unique
  MFA logic with data requests or updates.
- **Simple MFA Success Check:** When a response to a data request is sent, the system checks for a single boolean
 from the associated MFA smart contract, confirming that the necessary MFA requirements have been met.
- **Flexibility for Diverse Use Cases:** Smart services can implement any MFA method or combination thereof, catering to 
their specific security needs. This includes integration with custom MFA devices, such as palm scanners.

In conclusion, the Custom MFA and Sybil Attack Resistance feature of the zkp.services protocol offers unparalleled flexibility
and security. By providing both an in-house, on-chain MFA solution and the capability to integrate external MFA logic, the 
protocol ensures that diverse data applications can maintain their unique security standards while benefiting from advanced
cryptographic techniques.

## <h1>Tokenomics (Beta) of zkp.services</h1>

zkp.services introduces its native ERC-20 token, "ZKP", which plays a central role in the protocol's economy. This token is 
utilized in transactions involving data requests and responses, with a structure designed to balance incentives and maintain 
the token's value.

### Transaction Fees and Burn Mechanism

1. **Base Burn Fee:** Whenever a party requests data or a data update, they are charged a base burn fee. This fee is a 
fundamental aspect of each request transaction and serves two purposes:

   - **Spam Prevention:** By imposing a cost on data requests, the base burn fee acts as a deterrent against frivolous or 
   spam requests.
   - **Deflationary Mechanism:** The burn fee helps maintain or potentially increase the value of ZKP tokens by reducing the 
   overall supply, creating a deflationary effect.

2. **Transaction Completion Fee:** Completing an update/data transaction incurs a different fee from the recipient/responding
party. This fee comprises two components:

   - **Requester-Set Fee:** The party requesting the data/data update sets this part of the fee. It represents the fee that is
    to be transferred from the responder to the requester and can be thought of as the fee for the service that the requester 
    helps with such as paying for transportation.
   - **Burn Fee (currently inactive):** Similar to the base burn fee, this component is also deducted to discourage spam and 
   manage the token supply.

### Control and Consent

The party responsible for responding to data requests/completing requested updates retains full control over each transaction. 
They have the autonomy to accept or reject each data request based on the offered terms, including the fee set by the requester.

### Cross-Chain Backups and Payment

- **Initial Framework:** For chains supporting CCIP (Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol), the base fee for backups is standardized 
in ZKP tokens. This simplification is designed to enhance user experience by providing a consistent payment method across different chains.
- **Future Expansion:** Plans are in place to broaden the range of accepted tokens for cross-chain backup services. This expansion 
aims to offer greater flexibility and convenience to users engaging in cross-chain activities.

The tokenomics of zkp.services is built around a balanced system of fees and burn mechanisms, designed to ensure the stability and 
value of the ZKP token while facilitating a fair and controlled environment for data transactions. The incorporation of cross-chain
 functionality and future plans for token diversification further enhance the protocol's adaptability and utility in the evolving 
 blockchain ecosystem.
